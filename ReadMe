## Mircoservice A for Austin Christian

## 1. How to REQUEST Data

The mirco Sercive reads Calculator.txt and is waiting for a "Run \n" then "FGA, FGM, TPA, TPM". 
then sleep main for 5 secs and there will be a response. 

** Example (using C++ and a text file)
```cpp
    ofstream MyWriteFile("Calculator.txt");

    MyWriteFile << "run \n";
    MyWriteFile << fga << "," << fgm << "," << tpa << "," << tpm;
    MyWriteFile.close();
    sleep(10);
```

## 2. How to RECEIVE Data
after requesting data wait a few seconds and 
The microservice responds with a Text File Strings:


**Example (using C++ and a text file):**
```cpp
    ifstream MyReadFile("Calculator.txt");
    string myText;
    getline (MyReadFile, myText);
    printf("%s\n", myText.c_str());
    MyReadFile.close();

    float num = stof(myText);

    printf("Effective Field Goal Percentage %.2f\n", num);
```
